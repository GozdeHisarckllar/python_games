## PyGame Projects

The game projects that I built using Python and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library, after taking the Skillshare course ["An introduction to game development in python"](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/An-introduction-to-game-development-in-python/1357031970) by Christian Koch.

* Some of the main aspects that I focused while building these games were user input/event handling, timers and collision detection.

* The Meteor Dodger game mainly consists of PyGame Sprite & Pygame Group classes in contrast with the shooting range game. 

* Besides the main functionalities, I added these extra features to the Meteor Dodger game:
  - game intro state
  - keyboard input event listeners
  - shield and laser-booster sprites (spaceship boosters)
  - spaceship recovery with extra shields
  - score meter
  - saving/storing highest-score during the game session
  - laser enhancement (triple laser shooter)
  - meteors in variant sizes
  - sliding background
  - graphic & sound effects for collided game items
