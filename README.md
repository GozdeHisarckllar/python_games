## PyGame Projects

The game projects that I built through the Skillshare course ["An introduction to game development in python"](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/An-introduction-to-game-development-in-python/1357031970) using Python and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library.

* Some of the main aspects that I focused while building these games were user input/event handling, timers and collision detection.

* The Meteor Dodger Game mainly consists of PyGame Sprite & Pygame Group classes in contrast with the other game. 

* Besides the main functionalities, I added these extra features to the Meteor Dodger Game:
  - spaceship recovery 
  - saving/storing highest-score
  - laser acceleration (triple laser shooter)
  - intro state
  - shield and accelerator sprites
  - sliding background
